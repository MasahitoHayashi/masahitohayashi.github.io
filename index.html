        Welcome to <b>Masahito Hayashi</b>'s reserach group.
        Understanding the implications of recognizing matter and extracting information
        from it has been a long-standing issue in philosophy and religion. However,
        recently this problem has become relevant to other disciplines such as cognitive
        science, psychology, and neuroscience. Indeed, this problem is directly relevant to
        quantum mechanics, which forms the foundation of modern physics. In the process
        of recognition, information cannot be obtained directly from matter without any
        media.
