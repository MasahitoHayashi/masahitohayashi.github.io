<h3> Information Spectrum and Finite-block-size Analysis in Classical and Quantum Information </h3>

<div class="ml-3">
<p>Consider the problem of transmitting classical information via classical noisy channels as a typical problem in information theory. This problem is called classical channel coding, and it is possible to describe the optimal performance of channel coding in the asymptotic limit concerning the block-size of codes as Shannon’s channel-coding theorem, bur, in any real communication system, we can only use codes with finite block-size. Hence, it is necessary to estimate the optimal coding length $L_{\epsilon,n}$ among codes with block-size $n$ for a given allowable error probability $\epsilon&gt;0$. In fact, the traditional asymptotic analysis does not work for this problem for the following reason.
In Shannon’s channel-coding theorem, the asymptotic limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} L_{\epsilon,n}/n$ is treated as the channel capacity. However, the limit does not give a good approximation of $L_{\epsilon,n}$ %with block-size $n$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$ because the convergence is quite slow.  The reason for the inadequacy of the convergence is that the limit value does not reflect the error probability $\epsilon$, not uniform with respect to $\epsilon$, which is caused by the independence of $\epsilon$. Therefore, a good approximation for $L_{\epsilon,n}$ is required.</p>

<p>This problem becomes more serious in quantum communication because the quantum key distribution (QKD) system works only with finite-block-size codes. We cannot apply the result from the asymptotic theory directly to implemented QKD systems.</p>

<p>To derive a better approximation, I considered the asymptotic expansion of $L_{\epsilon,n}$ up to the second order $\sqrt{n}$ as $L_{\epsilon,n}\cong L_1 n+ L_{2,\epsilon}\sqrt{n}$ because the second order coefficient $L_{2,\epsilon}$ properly reflects the error probability $\epsilon$, so that the difference between $L_{\epsilon,n}$ and $L_1 n+ L_{2,\epsilon}\sqrt{n}$ is not so large.
Employing the information spectrum method, I derived the second order coefficient for 
classical channel coding as well as other many kinds of settings
which contain source coding, channel coding, and secure random number extraction 
[IEEE TIT \textbf{54} 4619 (2008), \cite{Ha08b-1} of \textbf{C3}]. %41
%Those results directly give the approximation of the optimal coding length with block-size $n$.
Indeed, although the existing result could solve only the discrete memoryless case for channel coding, 
my result applied to classical channel coding covers 
the Gaussian channel case, the energy constraint case and the Markovian case 
[IEEE TIT \textbf{55} 4947 (2009), \cite{Ha09b} of \textbf{C3}] %41
as well as the discrete memoryless case. 
The information spectrum method addresses only the logarithmic likelihood (ratio) for channels or sources, 
and does not consider the other properties of channels or sources. 
Since the analysis by this method is concentrated on the treatment of the logarithmic likelihood (ratio),
the method provides a unified viewpoint on several topics in information theory.
Thanks to the generality of the method, 
I succeeded in calculating the second order coefficients of the above problems.
%The simplicity of the derivation is clear because of the shortness of the total page lengths and the wideness of areas covered by two papers. 
%In particular, 
The paper [IEEE TIT \textbf{55} 4947 (2009), \cite{Ha09b} of \textbf{C3}] was awarded 
the 
\textbf{\textit{2011 IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award}}.
This award is presented to one or two of the most significant information theory papers worldwide by the IEEE Information Theory Society. 
Papers awarded this prize are among the most significant and ground-breaking in their year.</p>

<p>Indeed, the topic itself concerns the classical case. 
However, as mentioned in the first paragraph, the problem becomes more serious in the quantum case.
To resolve this problem in the quantum case, I first solved this problem in the classical case.
To address the quantum case,
I established the information spectrum method in quantum systems 
[IEEE TIT \textbf{49} 1753 (2003), \cite{HN03b} of \textbf{C3}] %113
%IEEE TIT \textbf{52} 1562 (2006), %13
%\&amp; IEEE TIT \textbf{53} 534 (2007)] %49
%[\textbf{M. Hayashi}, {\em Quantum Information: An Introduction}, Springer (2006)] 194
with Nagaoka.
%In particular, 
We derived a novel matrix inequality for this purpose, 
which has often been referred to as the
``Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality’’ in many papers for quantum channel coding.
We then applied it to the quantum setting and solved the problem of the second order coefficients 
in several quantum cases [QIP 2013, \cite{THc13-1} of \textbf{C2}].%4</p>

<p>The next problem was to derive the upper and lower bounds of the optimal coding length with block-size $n$ 
that attains the above optimal second order coefficient in the asymptotic sense. 
We can easily derive such upper and lower bounds if we are not concerned about the complexity.
However, the computability of bounds is required, as well as the tightness of bounds.
The essential point is the trade-off between the approximation error and the complexity. 
To clarify the trade-off, 
we proposed several upper and lower bounds, and demonstrated their hierarchy. 
%That is, more precise bound requires more calculation time.
Employing the hierarchy, we clarified which bound is most 
useful when the block-size $n$ is sufficiently large [QIP 2013, \cite{THc13-1} of \textbf{C2}].</p>

<h3> Analysis of Practical Quantum Key Distribution Systems </h3>

<div class="ml-3">
<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the theoretical proposal that is close to realisation in quantum information science. 
While an ideal QKD system is secure, 
the security of a realisable QKD system requires additional protocols and more careful discussion 
because of the many kinds of imperfections, e.g., noise of the quantum channel and imperfection of photon source. 
%Due to these imperfections, 
We need to attach error correction and privacy amplification to the conventional QKD protocol. Further, imperfection in photon sources introduces additional channel parameters that should be estimated.</p>

<p>Based on my work on wire-tap channels 
[IEEE TIT \textbf{52} 1562 (2006), \cite{Ha03b} of \textbf{C3}], %50
% IEEE TIT \textbf{57} 3989 (2011)]. %29
I developed a concrete and secure QKD protocol with small calculation time
while existing researches offered no such concrete protocol
[PRA \textbf{76} 012329 (2007)]. %57
Many implemented QKD systems utilise this protocol. 
The first essential point was to propose a protocol 
for privacy amplification by modifying a Toeplitz matrix whose calculation time is linear in the block size $n$ 
[PRA \textbf{76} 012329 (2007)]. 
Second, I proposed a method to perfectly estimate the additional channel parameters
whereas existing methods only estimated it partially 
[NJP \textbf{9} 284 (2007) \&amp; \cite{Hp8} of \textbf{C2}]. %20
As a result of this improvement, the key generation rate was extensively improved. 
Third, I clarified the amount of leaked information and derived the sacrificed bit length required for an arbitrary desired security 
level for the estimated channel parameters in 
the finite-block-size setting 
[PRA \textbf{74} 022307 (2006) %39
\&amp; PRA \textbf{76} 012329 (2007)] by using the trade-off between accessible information and quantum disturbance 
[PRL \textbf{100} 210504 (2008), \cite{BHH08} of \textbf{C3} ]. %23
Finally, in cooperation with the above channel parameter estimation, I derived a calculation formula for the sacrificed bit length with the form applicable to the realised QKD system 
[NJP \textbf{14} 093014 (2012), \cite{HT12} of \textbf{C2} \&amp; \cite{Hp8} of \textbf{C3}]. %3
%in preparation]. 
Using this formula, I addressed the trade-off between cost and accuracy for the estimation of leaked information 
[PRA \textbf{79} 020303(R) (2009), \cite{Ha09-1} of \textbf{C2}]. %4
This formula was chosen for use in the implemented QKD system by this project in Japan, 
which will be demonstrated over an installed optical fibre
because my analysis satisfies all practical and experimental requirements for the NICT project.</p>

<h3> Quantum Universal Protocols with Group Symmetries </h3>

<div class="ml-3">
<p>Quantum information has several information protocols, e.g., quantum source coding, quantum channel coding, and perfect entangled state generation from partial entangled states. 
Existing protocols depend on the parameters that describe the quantum information source and the quantum channel. 
However, it is quite difficult to identify these parameters in a quantum system.
Even if it is possible, the identification of the parameters may cause information loss due to the state reduction by measurement. 
Hence, protocols are required that universally work independently of these parameters. 
Using the method of types, 
Csiszar and K”{o}rner [\emph{Information Theory: Coding Theorems for Discrete Memoryless Systems}, Akad’emiai Kiad’o (1981)]
proposed universal protocols for classical source coding and classical channel coding. 
By contrast, in quantum systems, quantum universal protocols are required to have basis independence.
Hence, we cannot directly apply the original type method to quantum systems because 
the original type method can work only with an specific basis.
%In quantum systems, the universal protocols are required to works independently of the coordinate.
%However, to apply the original type method to quantum systems directly, we have to choose a basis.</p>

<p>%To resolve this problem, I remembered that
%the group representation theory enables us to treat physical properties independent of the coordinate.
I showed that the group representation theory can greatly simplify 
quantum state estimation with the $n$-copy case
by removing the basis dependence
[JPA \textbf{31} 4633 (1998)]. %27
%\&amp; JPA \textbf{33} 7793 (2000)]. %9
%Physics Reports, \textbf{448} 1 %107 
%Proc. QCMC 2, 99 (2002) %7
%JMP 49 102101 (2008) %33
%JPA 35 7689 (2002) %30 <br />
I then found a quite unexpected and remarkable similarity between the Schur duality in the group representation theory and the method of types
%[JPA \textbf{34} 3413 (2001) %19 \&amp; 
[JPA \textbf{35} 10759 (2002)]. %38
Based on this discovery, I invented quantum universal protocols for all of the above quantum coding problems 
%[PRA \textbf{66} 022311 (2002), %41
%PRA \textbf{66} 032321 (2002), %15
%QIC \textbf{2} 519 (2002), %16
%PRA \textbf{75} 062338 (2007), %16
[CMP \textbf{289} 1087 (2009), \cite{Ha09-4} of \textbf{C2} \&amp; %9
CMP \textbf{293} 171 (2010), \cite{Ha09-7} of \textbf{C2}]. %5
Thanks to these protocols, we can now choose our protocol without knowledge of the parameters of 
quantum information sources or channels. 
This property enables us to avoid additional measurements to identify the quantum system. 
In particular, using irreducible representation theory, I realised basis independence for the above protocols. 
I also guaranteed their performance by the sophisticated use of matrix inequalities.</p>

<p>I subsequently applied these techniques 
to the problem of distinguishing multi-partite entangled states [PRL \textbf{96} 040501 (2006), \cite{HMMOV03} of \textbf{C3}]. %102
%PRA \textbf{77} 012104 (2008) %55 
%JMP \textbf{50} 122104 (2009) %25
%NJP \textbf{12} 083002 (2010)]. %13
Since multi-partite entanglement is related to multi-user communication, in particular, to quantum networks 
[PRA \textbf{76} 040301(R) (2007)], % 17
%LNCS \textbf{4393} 610 (2007)], %26
these results are helpful for this project.</p>
