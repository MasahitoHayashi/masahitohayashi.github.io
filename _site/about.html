<h3 id="short-biography">Short Biography</h3>

<p>Masahito Hayashi received the B.S. degree from the Faculty of Sciences, Kyoto University, Japan, in 1994, and the M.S.
and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Kyoto University, Japan, in 1996 and 1999, respectively. He worked in Kyoto
University as a Research Fellow of the Japan Society of the Promotion of Science (JSPS) from 1998 to 2000, and worked in
the Laboratory for Mathematical Neuroscience, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN from 2000 to 2003, and worked in ERATO
Quantum Computation and Information Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) as the Research Head from 2000 
to 2006. He worked in the Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University as Associate Professor from 2007 
to 2012. In 2012, he joined the Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University as Professor. In 2020, he joined the
Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology as Chief Research
Scientist. Also, he worked in Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore as Visiting Research
Associate Professor from 2009 to 2012 and as Visiting Research Professor from 2012 to now. He also worked in Shenzhen
Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China as a Visiting
Professor from 2018 to now, and in Center for Quantum Computing, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China as a Research Scientist
from 2019 to now.</p>

<p>In 2011, he received Information Theory Society Paper Award (2011) for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5290292/">“Information-Spectrum Approach to Second-Order
Coding Rate in Channel Coding”</a>. In 2016, he received the Japan
Academy Medal from the Japan Academy and the JSPS Prize from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. In 2017, he was
promoted to <strong>IEEE Fellow</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This paper addresses the second order analysis of classical channel coding using the information spectrum method, and
solves several <em>open problems that had been unsolved for 47 years</em>. It was awarded the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/honors/information-theory-paper-award"><strong>2011 IEEE Information Theory
Society Paper Award</strong></a>, which is the most distinguished
paper award in the information theory community. This award is granted to one or two of the most significant
information theory papers worldwide by IEEE the Information Theory Society.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This paper studies the quantum channel coding using information spectrum method, a fundamental tool for
finite-block-size analysis, and introduces a powerful inequality in quantum Shannon theory. An extremely useful
byproduct of this paper is an operator inequality that is widely referred to as the <em>Hayashi-Nagaoka operator
inequality</em> in literature.</p>

Virmani, “Bounds on Multipartite Entangled Orthogonal State Discrimination Using Local Operations and Classical Communication,” <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.040501">Physical Review Letters</a>, Vol. 96, 040501 (2006).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper introduces a fundamental tool for local distinguishability of quantum states that has been applied in many
papers. It also clarifies the relation between several entanglement quantities.</p>

Hayashi</strong>, “General non-asymptotic and asymptotic formulas in channel resolvability and identification capacity and its application to wire-tap channel,” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1614083">IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</a>, Vol. 52, No. 4, 1562–1575 (2006).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper establishes a novel connection between channel resolvability and wiretap channel that yields tighter security
evaluation, and solves an open problem concerning channel resolvability proposed by Han-Verd'{u} in 1993.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>H. Nagaoka and <strong>M. Hayashi</strong>, “An information-spectrum approach to classical and quantum hypothesis testing for simple hypotheses,” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4069150">IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</a>, Vol. 53, No. 2, 534–549 (2007).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper establishes the quantum information spectrum to address quantum hypothesis testing, which is the most
fundamental topic in quantum information and provides a basic tool for many related topics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M. Hayashi</strong>, “Upper bounds of eavesdropper’s performances in finite-length code with the decoy method,” <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.012329">Physical Review A</a>, Vol.76, 012329 (2007); <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.019901">Physical Review A</a>, Vol.79, 019901(E) (2009).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper derives the relation between phase error probability and leaked information and provides a formula for leaked
information with imperfect photon source in quantum key distribution.</p>

  <p><strong>M. Hayashi</strong>, “Second-order asymptotics in fixed-length source coding and intrinsic randomness,” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4626060">IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</a>, Vol. 54, No. 10, 4619–4637 (2008).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper proposes the use of the information spectrum method for a unified approach for second order asymptotics,
which has been applied in many papers as a key idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M. Hayashi</strong>, “Exponential decreasing rate of leaked information in universal random privacy amplification,” IEEE <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5773033">Transactions on Information Theory</a>, Vol. 57, No. 6, 3989–4001 (2011).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper addresses security analysis when hash functions are applied. It applies hash function to wiretap channel, and
constructs a practical code with small encoding and decoding time.</p>
