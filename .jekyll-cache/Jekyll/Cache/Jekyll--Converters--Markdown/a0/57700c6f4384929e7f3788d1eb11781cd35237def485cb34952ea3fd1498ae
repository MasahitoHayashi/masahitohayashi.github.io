I"Ä<p>For the classical statistics, I studied the estimation of classical Markov chains. In this study, I established information geometrical method for a Markovian chain. Based on this method, I proposed a very efficient method to estimate Markovian chains from the obtained data. Furthermore, I extended this method to the estimation of a hidden Markovian process, which has many applications in various areas, e.g., Bioinformatics, Econometrics, and Population genetics. This work has been published in the Annual of Statistics in 2016 and  is considered as a representative work of information geometrical method in Markov chain.  It was cited as a typical work of information geometry in Efron‚Äôs paper <em>Curvature and Inference for Maximum Likelihood Estimates</em> and Amari‚Äôs book <em>Information geometry and its applications</em>. (Efron and Amari are the founders of information geometry.)</p>

<p>For the quantum statistics, I discussed the estimation of a quantum system and the estimation of a quantum state. Usually, a quantum state is parameterized by multiple parameters. The best estimates of the respective parameters require the measurements of the respective physical quantities. However, they are non-commutative. Hence, we need to address simultaneous measurements of non-commutative physical quantities. Since their perfect simultaneous measurement is impossible, we need to optimize their approximate simultaneous measurement. In the following paper, I derived this optimization in a general way when the size of prepared quantum data is sufficiently large. This result gives the basis of the statistics of a quantum system from the side of the information science.</p>
