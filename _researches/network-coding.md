In the multiparty quantum information processing, we need a quantum network. However, a quantum network has a bottleneck. To improve the performance of the quantum network, we need to improve the bottleneck. My paper below started the analysis of quantum network coding for the first time as Fig. 3. After this paper, many researchers started to study quantum network coding. I proposed several protocols to improve the bottleneck in the quantum network. For example, in one of my protocols, I proposed an efficient use of quantum teleportation. This protocol resolves the bottleneck in the quantum butterfly network.

This paper is the first paper of quantum network coding.

The proposed protocol in this paper has been experimentally implemented by Prof. Pan’s group in USTC.
